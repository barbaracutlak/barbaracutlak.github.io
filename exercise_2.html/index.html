      <h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
      <h3>J. R. Carpenter, </h3>
      <p>MARCH 2015</p>
    <p class="indent">The term <span class="mark-up-1">handmade</span> usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues.
    </p>
    <p class="indent"><strong>I evoke the term <span class="mark-up-1">handmade web</span> to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.</strong>
