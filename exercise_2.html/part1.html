        <p class="indent">Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic web and before the corporate web. <i>Handmade</i> is by no means the only or best term to define the web of this period.</p>

        <p class="indent">In her essay, <q>A Vernacular Web</q> (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as: 
             <blockquote>bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by <i>dot.com</i> ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.</blockquote> 

       <p class="indent">For more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied's excellent research on the amateur web, see: <i>One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age: Digging through the Geocities Torrent</i>.

        <p class="indent"><strong>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</strong></p>
